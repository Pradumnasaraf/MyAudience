## Audience Calculator

I build this project to help me calculate my total audience reach on social media platforms. 

### Getting Started

To get started, you can simply clone this repository and install the dependencies.

Clone the repository and install the dependencies and run the development server.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.
